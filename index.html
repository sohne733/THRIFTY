    <h1>THRI</h1>
    <h2>FTY</h2>
    <p> I recently decided to clear out my closet and brought a bunch of my old clothes to the local vintage store as a donation. Among the pile was a dress I had always liked but never actually wore. It hung in my closet for years, admired but untouched, and I convinced myself it was time to let it go. Yet, as soon as I left it at the store, a strange thing happened—I began to miss it. 
        I would find myself stopping by the store occasionally, under the pretense of browsing, but really, I was checking in on that dress. It sat there on the rack, patiently waiting for someone to claim it. With each visit, I felt a mix of regret and curiosity, wondering if someone would recognize its charm and give it a home. As the weeks passed, it remained, unsold, and I began to feel oddly insulted. Why wasn’t anyone buying it? Did no one see what I saw in it?</p>
        <p class="custom-text">Months went by, and the dress, once neatly hung and full-priced, was eventually moved to the clearance section, marked down to $12. The sight of it, slashed in price and still unchosen, tugged at me. I stood there for a moment, debating whether I should take it back. In that instant, it felt less like reclaiming a piece of clothing and more like rescuing an old friend. The decision became clear, and I bought it back.
            Now, as I sit here writing this, I’m wearing that very dress. It fits perfectly, and I can’t help but smile at the absurdity of the whole situation. It’s as if the dress and I were meant to be, after all that time.</p>
